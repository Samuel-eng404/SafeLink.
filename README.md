# SafeLink – ESP32-Based Proximity Bracelet System

**SafeLink** is a smart wearable system designed to enhance the safety of children and elderly individuals. It establishes a wireless proximity link between two ESP32-based bracelets—one worn by a parent or caregiver, and the other by a child or dependent. The system provides real-time distance estimation, directional guidance, and alert feedback to help prevent separation in crowded or hazardous environments.

## 💡 Key Features

- 📡 **Wi-Fi Communication:** ESP32 in dual mode — acts as AP for the child and connects as STA to parent’s phone.
- 🧭 **Compass-Based Direction:** The parent bracelet uses the QMC5883L sensor to display the direction to the child.
- 📏 **Distance Estimation:** RSSI values are used to approximate how far the child is.
- ⏰ **NTP Time Sync:** Parent bracelet synchronizes real-time clock from internet via NTP.
- 🔋 **Battery Monitoring:** Battery percentages shown for both devices.
- ⚠️ **Alerts:** Sound, vibration, and on-screen warnings for:
  - Distance thresholds
  - Tampering (reed switch)
  - Disconnection or timeout
